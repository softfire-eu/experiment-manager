# What is SoftFIRE?

SoftFIRE provides a set of technologies for building a federated experimental platform aimed at the construction and experimentation of services and functionalities built on top of NFV and SDN technologies.
The platform is a loose federation of already existing testbed owned and operated by distinct organizations for purposes of research and development.

SoftFIRE has three main objectives: supporting interoperability, programming and security of the federated testbed.
Supporting the programmability of the platform is then a major goal and it is the focus of the SoftFIRE’s Second Open Call.
